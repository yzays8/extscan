# extscan

extscan detects and reports mismatches between file extensions and file contents.

## Note

When using libmagic as the file detection engine, false positives may occur, particularly with text files, due to its dependence on libmagicâ€™s database. Magika provides similar functionality but offers better accuracy at the expense of increased scan time.

## Install

### Linux (Debian)

#### libmagic

```sh
sudo apt install libmagic-dev
```

#### Magika

```sh
pip install magika
```

If you plan to use Magika as the detection engine, you will also need to install [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/).

1. Download the appropriate ONNX Runtime release for your system from the [official repository](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases).

2. Extract the archive, for example:

   ```sh
   tar xzf onnxruntime-linux-x64-*.tgz
   ```

3. Set the `ORT_LIB_LOCATION` environment variable to the path of the extracted `lib` directory. For example:

   ```sh
   export ORT_LIB_LOCATION=/path/to/onnxruntime-linux-x64/lib
   ```

    You can add this line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) to make it persistent.
